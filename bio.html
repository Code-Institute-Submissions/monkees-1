        <h5>Introduction:</h5>
        <p>The Monkees were a group of four musicians originally from the 1960s show The Monkees. The show was created by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider and aired from 1966 to 1968. The four Monkees are named Micky Dolenz, Mike Nesmith, Peter Tork and Davy
            Jones. Micky Dolenz was the funny one who played the drums, often seen wearing a tablecloth. Mike Nesmith was the leader, a Texan, and played the guitar. He is often seen with sideburns and wearing a green hat. Peter Tork played the bass,
            guitar, banjo and piano and is often seen wearing mocassin boots and a belt buckle Davy Jones was British and played the tamborine and maracas. The Monkees have sold more than 50 million records worldwide, with international hits like "Last
            Train to Clarksville", "Pleasant Valley Sunday" and "Daydream Believer". The Monkees outsold the Beatles in 1967, with three albums released that year. Their record song was 'I'm a believer' hitting top of the charts in 1967.
