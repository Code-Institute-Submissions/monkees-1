# Monkee's Tribute Site


This is a Monkee's Tribute Web Site. Fans can visit this website in order to get information about The Monkees, listen to their music, and book them for a gig. The content illustrated on the website is content presented that is popular.
 
## UX

For the UX design process, I used an application called Pencil, to transfer my drawings to digital format for illustration. These are included in the ux folder. The UX design process allowed me to consider the requirements for the website - for example, how and what content was to be presented on the website that was revelant for the fans.

- I wanted the website to be intuitive to use and navigate, so I created a navigation bar that held all the pages. The bar also indicates the current location on the website that you are on.

- The website also provides a footer with links to the social websites of The Monkees. I wanted this, to portray that the website is a community website, linked to other resources.

- As a fan of the website, I wanted him or her to resonate with the most popular content, so I researched the most popular songs and videos of The Monkees that would suit the tribute fan site. These are presented on the videos page (see videospage UX diagram) and a popular song recording on the bio page (see biopage UX diagram).

- As someone new to the website or less familiar with The Monkees, I wanted to give some information about The Monkees, which is displayed on the intro page (see intropage UX diagram) and on the bio page (see biopage UX diagram).

- For those looking to hear The Monkees in person, I presented a list of current gigs (see gigs ux diagram), and also gave the option of booking an event themselves. I placed the Book Event button on the intro page (see intropage ux diagram) as well as the gigs page, so the user could see that the option was available from the start.

- The website also shows a group of pictures of the band members (see photos ux page) and a list of their songs and albums in chronological order (see songspage ux diagram).

## Features

Book Event - the website allows the user to submit interest by  booking an event. The website asks for your contact details and then sends them an acknowledgement after it receives them..

Listening to music - the website embeds popular youtube videos for the enjoyment of the fans.

Listing chronological songs / albums - the website presents all The Monkees latest and older content in chronological order.
 

### Features Left to Implement
- A fan based forum would be a good idea to implement in the future, where fans can gather and communicate with each other.

## Technologies Used

- [Bootstrap 4] (https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses an html / css  library called Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a library that allows user responsive design on all different kinds of screens and devices. It also has a good few features that were used in this project. The navigation bar, the footer, the album carousel, and the layout grid were all used. 

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses JQuery as a dependency for Bootstrap.

- [Font Awesome] (https://fontawesome.com/)
    - Font Awesome is a website with icons that can be used on a site. For this project, Font Awesome was used for the facebook, twitter and youtube icons in the footer.


## Testing

1. Navigation:
    1. Go to the "Home"page
    2. The Home page should be selected in the navigation bar.
    3. Click on another page in the navigation bar, for example 'Bio'
    4. The new page should display and be the current selection in the navigation bar.
    5. Do this for all other pages

2. Embedded Videos
    1. Go to videos page or bio page.
    2. Click on one of the videos.
    3. The video from youtube should loads up and play like you are listening from the youtube site.
    4. Do for each video

3. Book Event
    1. Click on book event on the introduction or gigs page.
    2. Fill in the details.
    3. Hit submit
    4. The website should confirm the details and send you to a webpage thanking you.

I tested the website on a laptop, a notebook, a tablet and a mobile phone. I also used the chrome / internet explorer developer tools to display it on different devices.

In some situations, I had to adjust space to accomodate different sizes.

The footer appeared to be problematic during testing. The bootstrap container grid adds in extra spacing, larger than the footer container, and this had to be changed. Also, the footer was appearing in the middle in certain pages, and this had to be fixed too.

## Deployment

The website is deployed on Github.

### Acknowledgements

- I received inspiration for a lot of the features of this site, by reading through the bootstrap documentation. The bootstrap documentation gave me inspiration to create the website in the easiest way possible, while allowing other screen sizes to be accomodated. Some of the features like the carousel album rotator were got from bootstrap documentation.
