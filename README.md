# Monkee's Tribute Site


This is a Monkee's Tribute Web Site. Fans can visit this website in order to get information about The Monkees, listen to their music, and book them for a gig. The content illustrated on the website is content presented that is popular.
 
## UX

For the UX design process, I used an application called Pencil, to transfer my drawings to digital format for illustration. These are included in the ux folder. The UX design process allowed me to consider the requirements for the website - for example, how and what content was to be presented on the website that was revelant for the fans.

- I wanted the website to be intuitive to use and navigate, so I created a navigation bar that held all the pages. The bar also indicates the current location on the website that you are on.

- The website also provides a footer with links to the social websites of The Monkees. I wanted this, to portray that the website is a community website, linked to other resources.

- As a fan of the website, I wanted him or her to resonate with the most popular content, so I researched the most popular songs and videos of The Monkees that would suit the tribute fan site. These are presented on the videos page (see videospage UX diagram) and a popular song recording on the bio page (see biopage UX diagram).

- As someone new to the website or less familiar with The Monkees, I wanted to give some information about The Monkees, which is displayed on the intro page (see intropage UX diagram) and on the bio page (see biopage UX diagram).

- For those looking to hear The Monkees in person, I presented a list of current gigs (see gigs ux diagram), and also gave the option of booking an event themselves. I placed the Book Event button on the intro page (see intropage ux diagram) as well as the gigs page, so the user could see that the option was available from the start.

- The website also shows a group of pictures of the band members (see photos ux page) and a list of their songs and albums in chronological order (see songspage ux diagram).

## Features

Book Event - the website allows the user to submit interest in booking an event. The website asks for your contact details and then sends them acknowledges receipt of them.

Listening to music - the website embeds youtube videos 
 


For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
